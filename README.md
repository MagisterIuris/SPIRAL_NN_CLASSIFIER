## ▶️ How to Run

### 1. Install dependencies:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

### 2. Train the model:

    python train.py

Model weights will be saved to `saved_model/spiral_model.pth`.

### 3. Evaluate the model:

    python test.py

You will see classification accuracy and a plot of predicted spiral classes.

### 4. Visualize decision boundary:

    python decision_boundary.py

This will generate a heatmap showing how the model separates the spirals.
